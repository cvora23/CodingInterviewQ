/*
 * Segment Tree | Set 2 (Range Minimum Query)

We have introduced segment tree with a simple example in the previous post.
In this post, Range Minimum Query problem is discussed as another example where Segment Tree can be used.
Following is problem statement.

We have an array arr[0 . . . n-1]. We should be able to efficiently find the minimum value from index qs (query start)
to qe (query end) where 0 <= qs <= qe <= n-1.

A simple solution is to run a loop from qs to qe and find minimum element in given range.
This solution takes O(n) time in worst case.

Another solution is to create a 2D array where an entry [i, j] stores the minimum value in range arr[i..j].
Minimum of a given range can now be calculated in O(1) time, but preprocessing takes O(n^2) time.
Also, this approach needs O(n^2) extra space which may become huge for large input arrays.

Segment tree can be used to do preprocessing and query in moderate time. With segment tree,
preprocessing time is O(n) and time to for range minimum query is O(Logn).
The extra space required is O(n) to store the segment tree.

Representation of Segment trees
1. Leaf Nodes are the elements of the input array.
2. Each internal node represents minimum of all leaves under it.

An array representation of tree is used to represent Segment Trees.
For each node at index i, the left child is at index 2*i+1, right child at 2*i+2 and the parent is at (i-1)/2.

Construction of Segment Tree from given array
=======================================================

We start with a segment arr[0 . . . n-1]. and every time we divide the current segment
into two halves (if it has not yet become a segment of length 1),
and then call the same procedure on both halves, and for each such segment we store the sum in corresponding node.
All levels of the constructed segment tree will be completely filled except the last level. Also, the tree will be a
Full Binary Tree because we always divide segments in two halves at every level. Since the constructed tree is always
full binary tree with n leaves, there will be n-1 internal nodes. So total number of nodes will be 2*n â€“ 1.
Height of the segment tree will be log n. Since the tree is represented using array and relation between parent and
child indexes must be maintained, size of memory allocated for segment tree will be 2 * 2 raise to log n - 1.

Query for minimum value of given range
========================================================

Once the tree is constructed, how to do range minimum query using the constructed segment tree.
Following is algorithm to get the minimum.

// qs --> query start index, qe --> query end index
int RMQ(node, qs, qe)
{
   if range of node is within qs and qe
        return value in node
   else if range of node is completely outside qs and qe
        return INFINITE
   else
    return min( RMQ(node's left child, qs, qe), RMQ(node's right child, qs, qe) )
}

// A utility function to get the middle index from corner indexes.
int getMid(int s, int e) {  return s + (e -s)/2;  }

// A utility function to get minimum of two numbers
int minVal(int x, int y) { return (x < y)? x: y; }

/*  A recursive function to get the minimum value in a given range

int RMQUtil(int *st, int ss, int se, int qs, int qe, int index)
{
    // If segment of this node is a part of given range, then return
    //  the min of the segment
    if (qs <= ss && qe >= se)
        return st[index];
