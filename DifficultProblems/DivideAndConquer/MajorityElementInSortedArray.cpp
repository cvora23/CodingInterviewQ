/*
 * Check for Majority Element in a sorted array
Question: Write a C function to find if a given integer x appears more than n/2 times in a sorted array of n integers.

Basically, we need to write a function say isMajority() that takes an array (arr[] ), arrayâ€™s size (n) and a
number to be searched (x) as parameters and returns true if x is a majority element (present more than n/2 times).

Examples:

Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 10}, x = 3
Output: True (x appears more than n/2 times in the given array)

Input: arr[] = {1, 1, 2, 4, 4, 4, 6, 6}, x = 4
Output: False (x doesn't appear more than n/2 times in the given array)

Input: arr[] = {1, 1, 1, 2, 2}, x = 1
Output: True (x appears more than n/2 times in the given array)

/*
 * METHOD 1 (Using Linear Search)
Linearly search for the first occurrence of the element, once you find it (let at index i),
check element at index i + n/2. If element is present at i+n/2 then return 1 else return 0.
