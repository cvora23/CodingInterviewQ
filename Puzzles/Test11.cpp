/*
 * If we pick up a sheet containing page number 45. What are the other pages that this sheet contains?




Answer:
On the back of 45, it is 46. The numbers are arranged in pairs, with
the first pair adding up to 64 and the second pair adding up to 66.
Then,
64-45 = 19
66-46 = 20
So the four pages in this sheet are 19, 20, 45, 46.
