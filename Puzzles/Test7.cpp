/*
 *  A man is allocated a task. He doubles the task done everyday.
If the man completely does the task in 18 days, how many days did
it take for the man to complete 25% of the task?


Answer: 16
100% of task = 18 days
As he doubles the task everyday. So,
50% of task = 17 days
25% of task = 16 days.
