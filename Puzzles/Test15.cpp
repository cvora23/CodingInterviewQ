 * You are allowed to touch the coins, but can’t tell which way up they are by feel.
 *  You are told that there are 5 coins head up, and 5 coins tails up but not which ones are which.
 *  Can you make two piles of coins each with the same number of heads up?
 *  You can flip the coins any number of times.
 */

/*
 * ANSWER:
Yes
Explanation:
Make 2 piles with equal number of coins. Now, flip all the coins in one of the pile.
Let’s consider a simple case:
P1 : H T T T T
P2 : H H H H T
By filping P1
P1 : T H H H H
P2 : H H H H T
P1(heads) = P2(heads)
