 * A Lady (L) bought an item of Rs 100 from the Shopkeeper (C).
 * She paid him through a 500 Rs Note. Realizing that he did not have change,
 * the shopkeeper C got change for that note from another shopkeeper (S) and paid Rs 400 to the Lady.
After a few days, S realized that the note is fake,
And this railed at C and took 500 Rs back from him.
So in this whole process how much money did C loose in the end?


Answer: 500
Explanation:
The total loss must be equal to total profit. Here the loser is C and the gainer is L.
Note: S doesnâ€™t gain anything because he just got his money back.
So, loss of C = gain of L = 100(for product) + 400(cash) = Rs.500
