 * 1:Puzzle 38 | (Tic Tac Toe Puzzle)
Statement:
The game of Tic-Tac-Toe is being played between two players and it is in below state after six moves.

   X  |   O   |
---------------------
   X  |       |
---------------------
   0  |   0   |  X


Can you answer following questions?
Who will win the game, O or X?
Which was the sixth mark and at which position?
Assume that both the players are intelligent enough.
 *
 * Solution:
 O will win the game. The sixth mark was X in square 9.


Explanation:
The 7th mark must be placed in square 5 which is the win situation for both X and O.
Hence, the 6th mark must be placed in a line already containing two of the opponents marks.
There are two such possibilities â€“ the 6th mark would have been either O
in square 7 or X in square 9.
As we know both the players are intelligent enough, the 6th mark could not be O
in square 7. Instead, he would have placed O in square 5 and would have won.
Hence, the sixth mark must be X placed in square 9. And the seventh mark will be O.
Thus O will win the game.
