						Question List
=============================================================

1: Given a number (200), compare it to four variables (E.G A,B,C,D) 
   and return true if they are all equal to the given number.
   Do this in the most efficient way, and if possible without if statements.

2: There is a chess board of dimension n X n. 
   You are given with 2 squares on that board S(x1,y1) ;M(x2,y2). 
   S is a fixed point. M can move diagonally. it can move any number of steps or jumps in 1 move . 
   Find the minimum number of moves M needs to reach S
   
3: Find missing element in the A.P.

4: Given a list of integers of size n, write a method to 
   write all permutations the list; do this in O(1) space Hint: No recursion.
   
5: Given an array, find the first element that appears an even number of times.

6: Given a circular linked list. Find the longest sequence of numbers, where a 
   sequence starts with any number, for example 3, and ends when you see that number
   again,another 3. 
   Imagine the circular linked list 
   3 8 9 7 2 1 3 4 6 [3] same as first element .i.e three.
   The longest sequence would be 3 8 9 7 2 1 , the other candidate being 3 4 6 
   Finding for instance,starting at 8 and getting to the same 8 wouldn't count as a valid sequence.  
   
7: Given a 8 by 8 matrix, find all possible paths , moving one cell downwards or
   on cell to the right,(one cell per movement ) from cell 0,0 , to cell 7,7 
   
8: Find the first non-repeated element in an unsorted array

9: You have a BST and you need to assign an appropriate value to neighbor of 
   all nodes (Explained in below example) 
   Node Structure
   node {
        node leftChild,
        node rightChild,
        T data,
        node neighbor
   }
	 A 
	/ \ 
	B C 
	/ \ \ 
	D E F 

	Based on above tree, 
	
	Node: Neighbor 
	A: NULL 
	B: C 
	D: E 
	E: F

10:two arrays given to you. First array contains number s. Second array contains key values. 

We need to find smallest window in first array which covers all second array elements. 
e.g: 

Input= {6,7,1,3,2,4,5,2,3,1,2,5} 
Keys = {2,5,1} 

answer: from 9th index to 11th index is the smallest window.

11: stream of numbers coming, get 'n' min elements at any point of time

12: Design a data structure which could perform the following operations in O(1): 
- Insert(), Delete(), Search(), getRandom() 

getRandom() should pick a "random" element from your data structure, 
and should not be predictable (for instance always picking the "first" 
element from your DS)

13: Given 2D Array of only 0s and 1s, Find the row which gives max decimal value. 

Input: int array[3][3] = {{0,1,0,}{1,1,0},{1,0,1}}; 
Output : 2(second row)...decimal value is 6

14: Given employee information in an organisation in the formal - emp_id,firstname,lastname,
reports_to in the following way 
{ 
string[] Values = new[] { 	"Mc Grill,Mc,Grill,Karmon",
							"Karmon,Zech,Karmon,Joe",
							"Mithun,Try,Mithun,Joe",
							"Joe,Top,Joe,",
							"Zara,Aman,Zara,Mc Grill",
							"Fizzy,Dude,Fizzy,Mc Grill"}; 

} 
Print the information from the top to bottom level in the way in terms of Hierarchy.
1) Top Joe 
2) Try Mithun 
2) Zech Karmon 
3) Mc Grill 
4)Aman Zara 
4) Dude Fizzy

15: Given a group of no.s you need to arrange them in a such a way that they result into maximum no. 
The input no. can be of more than 1 digit, don't change no. digits order.

16: Given a 1D array, implement function Sum(x1,x2) where x1 and x2 are indices of array.
 Find sum of all elements in between the given indices inclusive of them. 
 Do in Time complexity of O(1)

17: Given a string and two words which are present in the string, 
	find the minimum distance between the words 
	Eg: "the brown qucik frog quick the", "the" "quick" O/P -> 1 
	"the quick the brown quick brown the frog", "the" "the" O/P -> 2
	
18: How to find if a given expression is a valid arithmetic expression? 
	Eg:(())()) - Invalid expression, (()()) - Valid expression	
	
19: Given a linkedlist, write an algorithm to divide the linkedlist into two linkedlists,
    the first contains the Fibonacci numbers in the list and the second contains 
    the non-Fibonacci numbers. Test the algorithm after developing the code

20: Input argument of a method is a list of char array. The method have to print 
all the possible combination of input char(s)...For example if the input 
argument has ['A','B','C','D'] the output should be 
A,B,C,AB,AC,AD,BC,BD,CD,ABC,ABD,ACD,BCD,ABCD

21: An employee class has id, name and a vector of employees who reports him. 
	Given two employees find the common manager of them.CEO pointer is provided.
	
22: Given two Binary Trees (not BST). Each node of both trees has an integer value. 
	Validate whether both trees have the same integers, there could be repetitive integers.
	
ex- 
Tree1: 
5 
1 6 
5 4 3 6 

Tree2: 
1 
3 4 
6 5 
have identical integers.

23: Given a string which may contain parenthesis. 
We must verify the validity of the string. s
ex- 
1) "<ad675+-fkmfd>" is a valid string 
2) "<[((kskfhdbh7)" is invalid 
3) "[<<((shfs8))>>]" is valid 

Extension to the question - 
Suppose you had a hash table that told you how a parenthesis starts and how it
ends as a key value pair, how would you then validate the string. 
ex - <key,value> = < '(' , ')' > indicates '(' is a start parenthesis and ')' 
should be the end of that paranthesis. 
<'A','&'> indicates that 'A' is a start parenthesis and '&' is the end parenthesis. 

Note: Validity means a parenthesis that starts, must end.

24: Find the largest substring palindrome in a given string. 
	ex: input: abbac output: abba 
 
25: Print first and last node of all the levels of a tree. 
Ex if tree is - 

root->data = 1 
root->left->data = 2 
root->right->data = 3 
root->left->right->data = 4 
root->right->right->data = 6 
root->right->left->data = 5 
root->right->left->left->data = 7 
root->right->left->left->right->data = 8 

Output - 1 2 3 4 6 7 8 

26:Implement a function that returns the i-th most popular item sold at Amazon. 
You cannot rely on any libraries. 

class Item { 
String itemId; 
int quantitySold; 
} 

/** 
* Find the ith most popular item in the list. 
*/ 
String find(List<Item> items, int i) { 
// your code goes here 
}

27: Suppose you are given a puzzle that is represented as a matrix with 0s and 1s, 
where a 0 indicates you’re allowed to move into that position and 1 means you’re 
not allowed to move in that position. Write a function that given a start position
and an end position, returns a boolean value indicating if there exists a path 
from start to end. You are only allowed to move up, down, right or left. 
Diagonal movement is not allowed. 

28: Given an array of strings with only lowercase letters , create a function 
that returns an array of those same strings, but each string has its letters 
rearranged such that it becomes a palindrome (if possible, if not, return -1)

29: In a string detect the smallest window length with highest number of distinct 
characters. For eg. A = “aabcbcdbca”, then ans would be 4 as of “dbca”

30: Given two strings, return true if they are one edit away from each other, 
else return false. An edit is insert/replace/delete a character. 
Ex. {"abc","ab"}->true, {"abc","adc"}->true, {"abc","cab"}->false

31: Given a linked list and a positive integer n, reverse the order of 
nodes in between n and last but n nodes. 
example: 1->2->3->4->5, n=2. Output is 1->4->3->2->5

32: BST is given. 
Calculate and return array with a sum of every level. 
For example, 
1 
2 3 
4 5 1 2 

Output should be [1, 5, 12].

33: A string contains a-z, A-Z and spaces. Sort the string so that all lower cases are
at the beginning, spaces in the middle and upper cases at the end. 
Original order among lower and upper cases needs to remain the same. 
For example: a cBd LkmY becomes ackm BLY. Is there a way in O(n) without extra space?

34: Find an algorithm to find a word ladder between 2 words by changing just one 
letter at a time. All the words formed should be valid dictionary words. 
Eg. 
FOOL ->POOL->POLL->POLE->PALE->SALE->SAGE → COLD → CORD → CARD → WARD → WARM

13->14->15->12 
16->17->18 

1 6 
8 13 
1  6

42:How to design a LRU cache using heap(priority queue) ?

43: Rotate a array by N. N can be smaller of greater than the array length.

eg {}[]() 
followup : scale your solution and specify the right data structure to 
use if you have a lot of such bracket types

47: given an integer array , find all combinations which sum to a given number.

eg if input array is 6444 and sum =10

50: Given an array {2, 4, 6, 0, 1, 8, 1}, where each element represents the height 
of tower located at its index. I was supposed to tell how much 
maximum water can accumulate in this “valley” once it rains.

51:Given the encoding rule:
A -> 0
B -> 1
C -> 2
…
K -> 10
…
Z -> 25

given an encoded input.
E.g., Given input 10, two possible original strings are possible 
BA and K, the answer is 2.
