/*
 * Given a a Binary Tree, find the difference between the sum of nodes at
 * odd level and the sum of nodes at even level. Consider root as level 1,
 * left and right children of root as level 2 and so on.
 * For example, in the following tree, sum of nodes at odd level is (5+1+4+8)
 * which is 18. And sum of nodes at even level is (2+6+3+7+9) which is 27. Output
 * for following tree should be 18-27 which is -9.
