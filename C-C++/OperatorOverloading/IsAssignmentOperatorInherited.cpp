/*
 * Is assignment operator inherited?
In C++, like other functions, assignement operator function is inherited in derived class.

For example, in the following program, base class assignment operator function can
be accessed using the derived class object.

#include<iostream>

using namespace std;

class A {
 public:
   A & operator= (A &a) {
    cout<<" base class assignment operator called ";
    return *this;
   }
};

class B: public A { };

int main()
{
  B a, b;
  a.A::operator=(b); //calling base class assignment operator function
                    // using derived class
  getchar();
  return 0;
}
Output: base class assignment operator called
