/*
 * Typically, with malloc, we do not have control over where the memory is allocated within the heap.
 * We just get a pointer to a block of memory which could start at any memory address within the heap.
 * We need to work with these constraints by requesting enough memory that we can return a memory address
 * which is divisible by the desired value.
 * Suppose we are requesting a 100-byte chunk of memory, and we want it to start at a memory address that
 * is a multiple of 16. How much extra memory would we need to allocate to ensure that we can do so?
 * We would need to allocate an extra 15 bytes. With these 15 bytes, plus another 100 bytes right after that sequence,
 * we know that we would have a memory address divisible by 16 with space for 100 bytes.
 */


/*
 * Steps:
 * 1. We will use malloc routine provided by C to implement the functionality.
 * Allocate memory of size (bytes required + alignment â€“ 1 + sizeof(void*)) using malloc.
 * alignment: malloc can give us any address and we need to find a multiple of alignment.
 * (Therefore, at maximum multiple of alignment, we will be alignment-1 bytes away from any location.)
 * sizeof(size_t): We are returning a modified memory pointer to user, which is different from the one that would be returned by malloc.
 * We also need to extra space to store the address given by malloc, so that we can free memory in
 * aligned_free by calling free routine provided by C.
 * 2. If it returns NULL, then aligned_malloc will fail and we return NULL.
 * 3. Else, find the aligned memory address which is a multiple of alignment (call this p2).
 * 4. Store the address returned by malloc (e.g., p1 is just size_t bytes ahead of p2), which will be required by aligned_free.
 * 5. Return p2.
