 * Friend class and function in C++

Friend Class:-------- A friend class can access private and protected members of other class in which
it is declared as friend. It is sometimes useful to allow a particular class to access private members of other class.
For example a LinkedList class may be allowed to access private members of Node.

class Node
{
private:
  int key;
  Node *next;
  // Other members of Node Class

  friend class LinkedList; // Now class LinkedList can
                           // access private members of Node
};
Friend Function Like friend class, a friend function can be given special grant to access private and protected
members. A friend function can be:
a) A method of another class
b) A global function

class Node
{
private:
  int key;
  Node *next;

  // Other members of Node Class
  friend int LinkedList::search(); // Only search() of linkedList
                                  // can access internal members
};

Following are some important points about friend functions and classes:
1) Friends should be used only for limited purpose. too many functions or external classes are
declared as friends of a class with protected or private data, it lessens the value of encapsulation
of separate classes in object-oriented programming.

2) Friendship is not mutual. If a class A is friend of B, then B doesnâ€™t become friend of A automatically.

3) Friendship is not inherited (See this for more details)

4) The concept of friends is not there in Java.



A simple and complete C++ program to demonstrate friend Class

#include <iostream>
class A {
private:
    int a;
public:
    A() { a=0; }
    friend class B;     // Friend Class
};

class B {
private:
    int b;
public:
    void showA(A& x) {
        // Since B is friend of A, it can access
        // private members of A
        std::cout << "A::a=" << x.a;
    }
};

int main() {
   A a;
   B b;
   b.showA(a);
   return 0;
}
Output:

A::a=0


A simple and complete C++ program to demonstrate friend function of another class

#include <iostream>

class B;

class A
{
public:
    void showB(B& );
};

class B
{
private:
    int b;
public:
    B()  {  b = 0; }
    friend void A::showB(B& x); // Friend function
};

void A::showB(B &x)
{
    // Since show() is friend of B, it can
    // access private members of B
    std::cout << "B::b = " << x.b;
}

int main()
{
    A a;
    B x;
    a.showB(x);
    return 0;
}
Output:

B::b = 0


A simple and complete C++ program to demonstrate global friend

#include <iostream>

class A
{
    int a;
public:
    A() {a = 0;}
    friend void showA(A&); // global friend function
};

void showA(A& x) {
    // Since showA() is a friend, it can access
    // private members of A
    std::cout << "A::a=" << x.a;
}

int main()
{
    A a;
    showA(a);
    return 0;
}
Output:

A::a = 0
