/*
 * Sometimes implementation of all function cannot be provided in a base class because we don’t know the implementation.
 * Such a class is called abstract class. For example, let Shape be a base class. We cannot provide implementation of
 * function draw() in Shape, but we know every derived class must have implementation of draw(). Similarly an Animal
 * class doesn’t have implementation of move() (assuming that all animals move), but all animals must know how to move.
 * We cannot create objects of abstract classes.

A pure virtual function (or abstract function) in C++ is a virtual function for which we don’t have implementation,
we only declare it. A pure virtual function is declared by assigning 0 in declaration. See the following example.

// An abstract class
class Test
{
    // Data members of class
public:
    // Pure Virtual Function
    virtual void show() = 0;

   // Other members
};
A complete example:
A pure virtual function is implemented by classes which are derived from a Abstract class. Following is a simple
example to demonstrate the same.

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

class Base
{
   int x;
public:
    virtual void fun() = 0;
    int getX() { return x; }
};

// This class ingerits from Base and implements fun()
class Derived: public Base
{
    int y;
public:
    void fun() { cout << "fun() called"; }
};

int main(void)
{
    Derived d;
    d.fun();
    return 0;
}
Output:

fun() called
Some Interesting Facts:
1) A class is abstract if it has at least one pure virtual function.
In the following example, Test is an abstract class because it has a pure virtual function show().

// pure virtual functions make a class abstract
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

class Test
{
   int x;
public:
    virtual void show() = 0;
    int getX() { return x; }
};

int main(void)
{
    Test t;
    return 0;
}
Output:

Compiler Error: cannot declare variable 't' to be of abstract
 type 'Test' because the following virtual functions are pure
within 'Test': note: 	virtual void Test::show()
2) We can have pointers and references of abstract class type.
For example the following program works fine.

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

class Base
{
public:
    virtual void show() = 0;
};

class Derived: public Base
{
public:
    void show() { cout << "In Derived \n"; }
};

int main(void)
{
    Base *bp = new Derived();
    bp->show();
    return 0;
}
Output:

In Derived
3) If we do not override the pure virtual function in derived class, then derived class also becomes abstract class.
The following example demonstrates the same.

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
class Base
{
public:
    virtual void show() = 0;
};

class Derived : public Base { };

int main(void)
{
  Derived d;
  return 0;
}
Compiler Error: cannot declare variable 'd' to be of abstract type
'Derived'  because the following virtual functions are pure within
'Derived': virtual void Base::show()
4) An abstract class can have constructors.
For example, the following program compiles and runs fine.

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

// An abstract class with constructor
class Base
{
protected:
   int x;
public:
  virtual void fun() = 0;
  Base(int i) { x = i; }
};

class Derived: public Base
{
    int y;
public:
    Derived(int i, int j):Base(i) { y = j; }
    void fun() { cout << "x = " << x << ", y = " << y; }
};

int main(void)
{
    Derived d(4, 5);
    d.fun();
    return 0;
}
Output:

x = 4, y = 5


Comparison with Java
In Java, a class can be made abstract by using abstract keyword. Similarly a function
can be made pure virtual or abstract by using abstract keyword. See
Abstract Classes in Java for more details.

Interface vs Abstract Classes:
An interface does not have implementation of any of its methods, it can be considered
as a collection of method declarations. In C++, an interface can be simulated by making
all methods as pure virtual. In Java, there is a separate keyword for interface.
