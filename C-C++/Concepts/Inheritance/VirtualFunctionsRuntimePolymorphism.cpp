Output:

In Derived
The main thing to note about the above program is, derived class function is called using a base class pointer.
The idea is, virtual functions are called according to the type of object pointed or referred, not according to
the type of pointer or reference. In other words, virtual functions are resolved late, at runtime.

What is the use?
Virtual functions allow us to create a list of base class pointers and call methods of any of the derived classes
without even knowing kind of derived class object. For example, consider a employee management software for an
organization, let the code has a simple base class Employee , the class contains virtual functions like raiseSalary(),
transfer(), promote(),.. etc. Different types of employees like Manager, Engineer, ..etc may have their own implementations
of the virtual functions present in base class Employee. In our complete software, we just need to pass a list of
employees everywhere and call appropriate functions without even knowing the type of employee. For example,
we can easily raise salary of all employees by iterating through list of employees. Every type of employee
may have its own logic in its class, we donâ€™t need to worry because if raiseSalary() is present for a
specific employee type, only that function would be called.

class Employee
{
public:
    virtual void raiseSalary()
    {  // common raise salary code  }

    virtual void promote()
    { //common promote code  }
};

class Manager: public Employee {
    virtual void raiseSalary()
    {  //Manager specific raise salary code, may contain
       //   increment of manager specific incentives  }

    virtual void promote()
    { // Manager specific promote  }
};

// Similarly, there may be other types of employees

// We need a very simple function to increment salary of all employees
// Note that emp[] is an array of pointers and actual pointed objects can
// be any type of employees. This function should ideally be in a class
// like Organization, we have made it global to keep things simple
void globalRaiseSalary(Employee *emp[], int n)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        emp[i]->raiseSalary(); // Polymorphic Call: Calls raiseSalary()
                               // according to the actual object, not
                               // according to the type of pointer
}
like globalRaiseSalary(), there can be many other operations that can be appropriately done on a
list of employees without even knowing the type of actual object.
Virtual functions are so useful that later languages like Java keep all methods as virtual by default.

How does compiler do this magic of late resolution?
Compiler maintains two things to this magic:
virtualFuns
vtable: A table of function pointers. It is maintained per class.
vptr: A pointer to vtable. It is maintained per object (See this for an example).

Compiler adds additional code at two places to maintain and use vptr.
1) Code in every constructor. This code sets vptr of the object being created. This code sets vptr to point to vtable of the class.
2) Code with polymorphic function call (e.g. bp->show() in above code). Wherever a polymorphic call is made, compiler
inserts code to first look for vptr using base class pointer or reference (In the above example, since pointed or
referred object is of derived type, vptr of derived class is accessed). Once vptr is fetched, vtable of derived
class can be accessed. Using vtable, address of derived derived class function show() is accessed and called.

Is this a standard way for implementation of run-time polymorphism in C++?
The C++ standards do not mandate exactly how runtime polymophism must be implemented, but compilers generally use
minor variations on the same basic model.
