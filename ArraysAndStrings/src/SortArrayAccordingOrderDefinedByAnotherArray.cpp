/*
 * Sort an array according to the order defined by another array
 * Given two arrays A1[] and A2[], sort A1 in such a way that the
 * relative order among the elements will be same as those are in A2.
 * For the elements not present in A2, append them at last in sorted order.
 * Input: A1[] = {2, 1, 2, 5, 7, 1, 9, 3, 6, 8, 8}
 * A2[] = {2, 1, 8, 3}
 * Output: A1[] = {2, 2, 1, 1, 8, 8, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9}
 * The code should handle all cases like number of elements in A2[] may be more
 * or less compared to A1[]. A2[] may have some elements which may not be
 * there in A1[] and vice versa is also possible.
 */

/*
 * Method 1 (Using Sorting and Binary Search)
 * Let size of A1[] be m and size of A2[] be n.
 * 1) Create a temporary array temp of size m and copy contents of A1[] to it.
 * 2) Create another array visited[] and initialize all entries in it as false.
 * visited[] is used to mark those elements in temp[] which are copied to A1[].
 * 3) Sort temp[]
 * 4) Initialize the output index ind as 0.
 * 5) Do following for every element of A2[i] in A2[]
 * â€¦..a) Binary search for all occurrences of A2[i] in temp[], if present then copy all
 * occurrences to A1[ind] and increment ind. Also mark the copied elements visited[]
 * 6) Copy all unvisited elements from temp[] to A1[].
 *
 * Time complexity: The steps 1 and 2 require O(m) time.
 * Step 3 requires O(mLogm) time. Step 5 requires O(nLogm) time.
 * Therefore overall time complexity is O(m + nLogm).
