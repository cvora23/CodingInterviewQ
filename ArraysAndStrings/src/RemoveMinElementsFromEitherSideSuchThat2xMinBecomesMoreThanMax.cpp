/*
 * Remove minimum elements from either side such that 2*min becomes more than max
 * Given an unsorted array, trim the array such that twice of minimum is greater than maximum in the trimmed array.
 * Elements should be removed either end of the array.

Number of removals should be minimum.

Examples:

arr[] = {4, 5, 100, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 200}
Output: 4
We need to remove 4 elements (4, 5, 100, 200)
so that 2*min becomes more than max.


arr[] = {4, 7, 5, 6}
Output: 0
We don't need to remove any element as
4*2 > 7 (Note that min = 4, max = 8)

arr[] = {20, 7, 5, 6}
Output: 1
We need to remove 20 so that 2*min becomes
more than max

arr[] = {20, 4, 1, 3}
Output: 3
We need to remove any three elements from ends
like 20, 4, 1 or 4, 1, 3 or 20, 3, 1 or 20, 4, 1

/*
 * Naive Solution:
 * A naive solution is to try every possible case using recurrence.
 * Following is the naive recursive algorithm. Note that the algorithm only
 * returns minimum numbers of removals to be made, it doesn’t print the
 * trimmed array. It can be easily modified to print the trimmed array as well.
 * // Returns minimum number of removals to be made in
 * // arr[l..h]
 * minRemovals(int arr[], int l, int h)
 * 1) Find min and max in arr[l..h]
 * 2) If 2*min > max, then return 0.
 * 3) Else return minimum of "minRemovals(arr, l+1, h) + 1" and "minRemovals(arr, l, h-1) + 1"
