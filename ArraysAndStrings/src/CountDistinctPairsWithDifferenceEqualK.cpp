/*
 * Count all distinct pairs with difference equal to k
Given an integer array and a positive integer k,
count all distinct pairs with difference equal to k.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = {1, 5, 3, 4, 2}, k = 3
Output: 2
There are 2 pairs with difference 3, the pairs are {1, 4} and {5, 2}

Input: arr[] = {8, 12, 16, 4, 0, 20}, k = 4
Output: 5
There are 5 pairs with difference 4, the pairs are {0, 4}, {4, 8},
{8, 12}, {12, 16} and {16, 20}

/*
 * Method 1 (Simple)
 * A simple solution is to consider all pairs one by one and check difference
 * between every pair. Following program implements the simple solution.
 * We run two loops: the outer loop picks the first element of pair, the
 * inner loop looks for the other element. This solution doesnâ€™t work if
 * there are duplicates in array as the requirement is to count only distinct pairs.

/*
 * Method 2 (Use Sorting)
We can find the count in O(nLogn) time using a O(nLogn) sorting algorithm like Merge Sort,
Heap Sort, etc. Following are the detailed steps.

1) Initialize count as 0
2) Sort all numbers in increasing order.
3) Remove duplicates from array.
4) Do following for each element arr[i]
   a) Binary Search for arr[i] + k in subarray from i+1 to n-1.
   b) If arr[i] + k found, increment count.
5) Return count.
