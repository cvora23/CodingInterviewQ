/*
 * what is different of Logical address and Physical address between father process and child processï¼Ÿ
 */

/*
 * Initially both parent and child share the page(logically and physically) as long as they don't write to the page,
 * when one of the processes attempts to write something to the page, then an extra copy of the page will be allocated. That is copy-on-write.

Therefore, parent and child process could share same physical page as long as the page is read-only
(like pages in text segment or some shared-library segment. it is different when saying the page is marked as read-only in page table,
see reference below for more info) or no one attempts to write the page. When copy-on-write occurs, the logical and physical mappings
should be different in parent and child process.
