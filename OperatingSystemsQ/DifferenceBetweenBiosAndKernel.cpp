/*
 * Difference between BIOS and Kernel
 */

/*
 * Kernel is one of the most important part of Operating System. We use the word kernel to mean the part of operating system
 * that runs in the privileged mode (Sometimes even a subset of this). Kernel is closer to the hardware and often performs
 * tasks like memory management and system calls.

Now for BIOS (Basic Input-Output System), it is the one which is responsible to provide drivers for new devices to OS.
BIOS constitutes of the code that is stored in read-only memory (ROM) and some configuration data in non-volatile RAM.
BIOS provides three primary functions:

Power on self test (POST), so it knows where to load the boot program.
Load and transfer control to boot program .
Provide drivers for all devices.
The main BIOS is supplied as a chip on the motherboard. It contains everything needed to perform the above three functions.
Additional BIOSes on other boards can provide access to additional devices.
