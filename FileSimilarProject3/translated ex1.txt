name of exercise: ex1

note that u should pay attention to the output u give for example if u had to print "Hello World" and accidently
printed "HEllo world" or "ello World" u wil get 0 grade.

U MUST CHECK every time if function succeded or failed. if failed u should print massage to STDERR and exit programm while of course free all memory and exit all 
open things.

Dont print nothing more than U ASKED TO PRINT, it will give u 0 grade.

part 1:

name of source file u need to send : ex11.c

write program who gets names and paths of two files as parameters to the main and checks if the two files are identical.
if the files are similar program will return 3, if files are identical prog return 2, otherwise return 1; (note u shouldnt print these to the screen)

files are identical if they contain exactly the same content
files are similar if they  contain the same content but there are differences in capital\small letters, spaces, and enters
for example:
1. 12ab23
2. 12Ab23
3. 12 aB   23
4.1 2
  ab2
  3

all 4 are similar

when compiling the program give it the name comp.out instead of a.out

example of running the program:
[hajajch@localhost ~]$ ./comp.out /home/hajajch/code/1.txt /home/ hajajch/2.txt

after running this, if the two files identical and ill do the command echo $? i will get 2, if they just similar 3, and 1 otherwise.

examples:

[hajajch@localhost ~]$ ./comp.out /home/hajajch/code/1.txt /home/hajajch/code/2.txt
[hajajch@localhost ~]$ echo $?
1
[hajajch@localhost ~]$


[hajajch@localhost ~]$ ./comp.out /home/hajajch/code/1.txt /home/hajajch/code/1.txt
[hajajch@localhost ~]$ echo $?
2
[hajajch@localhost ~]$

part 2:

name of source file u need to send : ex12.c

write programm who gets name and path to configuration file as a parameter to the main in the line of running the program.
file contains 3 lines:
1. location of folder who contains sub folders(each sub folder is a username) who contains c files.
2. location and name of file who contains input
3. location and name of file who contains suitable output for the input from line 2

your programm should enter all sub folders of the folder from line 1, search there and in the sub folders, for C file,
compile it(the c file) and run the exe file created from the compilation with the input from line 2.
your programm inputs from stdin and outputs to stdout so u use i/o redireactions.
U can assume that there will be no more than 1 C file in each folder, but mayB there are none (0).

now u should compare the output with the desired output from line 3 by using the comp.out program u just implemented in the previous part.
just run comp.out and give it as parameters to the main the location of the correct output from line 3 and the output of the current student
programm u just run(each folder is student username).

ur program should create file(in the folder from which u run the program) named results.csv who contains for each student(subfolder) his grade
according to the value returned by comp.out (grade will be 0-100) and description.
put "," between sudent name and his grade, and another "," between the grade and description.

list of descriptions:
1.NO_C_FILE - this will be in case there is no .c file in the folder. in this case grade will be 0!
2.COMPILATION_ERROR - in this case grade 0!
3.TIMEOUT - in case programm run for more than 5 seconds. grade 0!
4.BAD_OUTPUT - in case the output not identical or similar to the correct output. grade 0!
5.SIMILLAR_OUTPUT - in case the output not identical but similar. grade 80.
6.WRONG_DIRECTORY - in case the c file is not in the folder with the name of the student.
  in this case grade will be evaluated but the formula 100 - 10x when x is the depth.
  for example in this case: home/hajajch/ex1/chen/1/2/3/4 x=4 so grade will be 60.if grade will be lower than 0 update it to 0.
7.GREAT_JOB - correct output, grade 100!

example of results.csv:
Chen,100,GREAT_JOB
Dan,0,NO_C_FILE
Moshe,0,TIMEOUT
Dolev,0,COMPILATION_ERROR
Igor,0,BAD_OUTPUT
Guy,80,SIMILLAR_OUTPUT
Sam, 70, WRONG_DIRECTORY

example of configuration file:
/home/hajajch/ex1
/home/hajajch/code/input.txt
/home/hajajch/code/output.txt

example for content of input file(line 2):
1
3 4
4

example for content of output file(line 3):
Please enter operation
Please enter two numbers
The sum is 7
Please enter operation
Bye

example to run exe file of ur program:
[hajajch@localhost ~]$ ./a.out /home/hajajch/confFile.txt

remarks:
1.assume gcc defined in path so u can use execvp
2.use only system call funcs: fork,dup.dup2,exec,open,write,read. U R NOT ALLOWED TO USE ANOTHER ALTERNATIVE LIBRARY FUNCTIONS!
3.assume that comp.out is in the current folder(./) from which the run file of ur part 2 programm will be run.
4.when SYSCALL failed print error massage using write to the file descriptor number2(stderr)
5.each line wont be above 160 characters
6.order of students in results.csv file is not important
7.U MUST DELETE ALL FILES UR PROG CREATED, just no the results.csv file, AT THE END OF RUN. u should do that using UNLINK.
8. if students programm run longer than 5 seconds u should not finish it, but u should know it, so u can give him suitable grade and description(TIMEOUT)
9.each folder in linux contain "." and ".." for the current and previous folders. pay attention to it while using readdir.
